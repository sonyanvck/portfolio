      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <section>
          <p>I was born in Aurora, Colorado, a suburb east of Denver. I lived there until I was about 10 years old which is when my dad moved us back to his home state of Pennsylvania.
            I lived in and around Pittsburgh until I finished college, then I moved around the country about 5 times.
            I had studied fashion merchandising and advertising in college, however, I didn't find it to be my passion in life.
            I worked in restaurants for several years before finding myself in the eyecare world.
            I currently work as an ophthalmic technician and am now working on switching careers.
